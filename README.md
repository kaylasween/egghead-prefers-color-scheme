In this lesson, Kayla shows how to use the `prefers-color-scheme` media query in CSS to use system preferences to determine whether we need to display a website in light mode or in dark mode. This lesson starts in light mode and adds additional styles for dark mode (`prefers-color-scheme: dark`). However, this also applies when going from dark mode to light mode (`prefers-color-scheme: light`). The example only uses HTML and CSS, but you can use whatever front-end development method or framework you want as long as you can write media queries.
